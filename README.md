<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## Introduction

EzPay is a bill splitting mobile application which allows users to easily and accurately split up bills among a group of people. 
This application allows users to quickly and easily keep track of which people owe what,
and can provide a convenient way for people to pay each other back.

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features

1. The main feature is the ability to quickly and easily divide up bills between a group of people.
This feature is often used when people are out to dinner, or when a group of people are splitting up a shared expense. 
EzPay allows users to specify how much each person is responsible for, 
and can also track payments to ensure that everyone pays their fair share.

2. The application can also be used to track shared expenses over a period of time. This can be useful when people are sharing a house or an apartment, or when people are splitting up the cost of a vacation. The application can also be used to track expenses related to a business, such as when contractors are hired to do a job.

3. The application can also provide users with a convenient way to pay each other back. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as GPay, PayTM, PayPal, or even direct bank transfers. This can be especially helpful if a user does not have enough cash on hand to pay for their portion of the bill.

<!-- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS -->
## System Requirements

The app is designed to work on Android phones. 
The application requires an internet connection to access the features and permission to contact list. 

<!-- SECURITY -->
## Security

The app is designed with security in mind. All data is encrypted and stored securely. 
The application also has built-in measures to protect against malicious attacks.

<!-- BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS -->
## Benefits and Drawbacks

Benefits:
The primary benefit of using EzPay is that it makes it easy for users to split payments among a group of people. 
This eliminates the need for manual calculations and makes it much easier to keep track of who has paid and who still owes money. 
Additionally, the ability to store payment information, track payments, and generate reports makes it much easier to manage finances.

Drawbacks:
There are a few drawbacks to using EzPay. 
One of the main drawbacks is that if the application does not support multiple currencies, 
it may be difficult for users to pay for goods and services in different currencies.
